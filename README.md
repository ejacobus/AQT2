**Starting Up Local Dev Server (npm installed)**

1. Open a command prompt in the project's root directory
2. Type: `npm install` This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file. (first run only)
3. Type: `npm start` This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
